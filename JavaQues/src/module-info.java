/*FEATURES - Simple,object-oriented,portable,platformindependent,secured etc,.
 
 *OOPS - It is like having data and methods defined in the class to which it belongs creating
        objects that contain both data and methods. 
  
 *IF - if a boolean expression evaluates to true the body of if statement will executed.
       if a boolean expression evaluates to false the body of if statement will skipped. 
  
 *IF ELSE - if a boolean_expression evaluates to true the body of if statement will executed.
            if a boolean_expression evaluates to false the body of else statement will executed. 
  
 *IF ELSE IF -  The if_else_if statement allows us to make a choice from two options , if you need to 
                make a choice from more than 2options, we can use another else part in the 
                if else statement. 
 
 *WHILE - Body of while loop is executed as long as the boolean expression is true. 
 
 *DO-WHILE - If the no.of iteration is not fixed and u must have to execute the loop atleast once it is 
             recommended to use while loop 
  
 *FORLOOP -  It is a control flow statement that iterates a part of the programs multiple times.

                                       ****OOPS****  
                                          
 * OOP is for creating objects that contain both data and methods                                                                                                           
 * OOPS - It is like having data and methods defined in the class to which it belongs creating
        objects that contain both data and methods. 
                                           
 * INHERITANCE -  It is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class 
                without modifying it.      4--types.
                
       single - Every element in class a derived from class b ,
       multi - From 2level class created 1,
       herarchical - from2 class created 1-class,
       multiple - From a single class created multiple.
       
 * ENCAPSULATION - Every java class is an example of encapsulation because we write within class.
                  Using oops in java we restrict access to methods and variables .
                  This prevents data from direct modification is known as encap.
                  
 * POLYMORPHISM - It is like a common interface for multiple forms(data types),
                 suppose we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape options
                 (rectangle,square,circle).however we could use the same method to color any
                  shape this concept is known as polymorphism.                                 
  
 * ABSTRACTION - Abstraction allows displaying only the important information and hiding
                 the implementation details. for example: while riding a bike, u know that
                 if u raise the accelerator, the speed will increase, but u dont know how it
                 actually happens .this is data abstraction as the implementation details 
                 are hidden from the rider.
 
 * INTERFACE - it allows us to declare methods without defining them. any class that implements
              an interface defines the methods of the interface. 
  
 * CLASS - A CLASS IS A USER DEFINED BLUEPRINT OR PROTOTYPE FROM WHICH OBJECTS ARE CREATED. 
  
 * OBJECT -  AN OBJECT IS AN INSTANCE OF A CLASS. IT IS A REAL WORLD ENTITY. 
  
  
  
                                   
                                     ****EXCEPTION****
                                     
 * EXCEPTIONHANDLING - Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as 
                       ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
  
 * EXCEPTION - It is a kind of notification that interrupts the normal execution of a program. 
 
 * CHECKED - The exception which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of the program
            at runtime. using (try,catch) checked excep should be handled.
     
 * UNCHECKED - The exception which are not checked by compiler whether the programmer handling or not
              such type of exception by default consider as unchecked.           
  
 * TRY/CATCH - its used to handle exceptions. The try block defines a set of statements that may
              lead to an error. The catch block basically catches the exception. 
  
 * FINALLY - Finally contains the block of code that must be executed whether
            an exception occurs or not. 
 
 * FINAL - It is used with the classes, methods and variables.
 
 * FINALIZE - Used to perform cleanup processing just before object garbage is collected.
 
 * THROW - The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions.
  
 * THROWS - Used to indicate what exception type may be thrown by a method. 
  
 * CONSTRUCTOR - It is a method used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object 
                 of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes. 
                 In java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. 
                 
                 Constructor is used to create an object.
